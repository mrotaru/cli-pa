# habitg

Like [habitrpg](https://habitrpg.com), but with less role playing. So no
swords, armor or many such features. It just didn't work for me. Point values
are still assigned to tasks - and you win/lose points by completing or not
completing them. Rewards will be purchased with points.

It will be available as a command line application and store data in a text
file - therefore not needing a server/database. A website might be created in
the future.
